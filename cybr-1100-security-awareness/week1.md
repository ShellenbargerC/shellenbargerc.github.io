# Week 1 – Intro To Cybersecurity
 
**Description:**  
What was covered this week? Summarize key ideas in 2–3 sentences.  

One major thing that was covered is the importance of syber security and ethics. We also talked about the circles and flows of how cyber security matters.

 
**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  

The importance of cybersecurity was brought up a lot, we talked about methods of payment and also how hackers can try to get into systems. One of the topics brought up
which I learned from and also want to pursue finding more information on and how to prevent is man in the middle attacks. I also was interested to hear how many
people ged hacked simply because of bad password security and/or lack of two factor authentication.

**AI Use Note:**  
If you used an AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), briefly describe how you used it (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading).

I did not for this course other than to get a better understanding of github settings and configuratios.
