# Week 1 – Computer Hardware & Operating Systems
 
**Description:**  
What was covered this week? Summarize key ideas in 2–3 sentences.  

One major thing covered this week was connectors and the different types and forms. Another topic that was covered was physically disassembling computers and looking at the components. 
 
**Artifacts:**  


**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  

One of the main things that I learned that I wasnt aware of is how many different types of connectors there are and how many uses they have. It didnt occur to me how much just removing a simple piece could affect a system as a whole until we started going over the different form factors and such through class and in our labs. 
 
**AI Use Note:**  
If you used an AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), briefly describe how you used it (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading).

I used chatgpt for making study guides.
