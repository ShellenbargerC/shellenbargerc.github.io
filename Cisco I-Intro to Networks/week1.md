# Week 1 – Intro To Networks
 
**Description:**  
What was covered this week? Summarize key ideas in 2–3 sentences.  

One major thing covered this week that was went over was the importance of networks and we briefly discussed file sharing and storage.
 
**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace.  

One main thing I got used to this week during class was using github and making repositories. We also talked about the importance of having a portfolio and how good it can look for employers. This is something i had not previously thought of, but it makes sense that having a copied log of all of the work that we have completed in our courses via github will be very useful. 
 
**AI Use Note:**  
If you used an AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), briefly describe how you used it (e.g., brainstorming, proofreading).

I did not for this course other than to get a better understanding of github settings and configuratios.
